# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
This challenge allowed me to use the statiscal packages in R in order to analyze a set of data. 

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

In Part 1 of the challenge I used linear regression in R to analyze the car data across all the variables. After analyzing the summary data if I assume a signficance level of 5% the p-value of many of the variables is significantly less than .05 therefore I can't say that there is significant evidence to reject the null hyypothesis, which means the slope of our linear model is not zero and the difference in mpg performance was not by random chance.  Looking specifically at each variable individually. All of the variables are significant, with the exception of vehicle_weight, spoiler_angle,and AWD these particualar attributes did not have a significant impact on MPG performance. The r-squared is greater than .7 which shows a positive linear relationship (please refer to screenshots).

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
In Part 2 of the challenge I was asked to analyze and summarrize in R the weight capacities of multiple suspension coils to determine if the manufacturing process is consistent across production lots.  In the Total_summary dataframe I was able to determine the mean, median, variance, and standard deviation overall of the lots (see Total_summary table). This initial analysis showed a mean of approximately 1500 for the PSI wwith a standard deviation of 7.9. When repeating the analysis by lot, Lot 1 and 2 appear to have a similar mean with Standard deviations of approximately 2 or less. However, LOT 3 had a much wider standard deviation of 13 and a very high variance with suggest that this manufactoring lot was different.

## Summary T-Tests for Suspension Coils
In Part 3 of the challenge I was asked to perform a T-test analysis of the suspension coils and compare it to the population mean of 1500 per square feet. I performed a overall 1 tail T-test to determine if I could reject the null hypothesis. Based on my overall analysis (see overall_statistics vs population png). Based on this T-Test, assuming a significance level of .05%, I am unable to reject the null hypothesis that there is a significant difference betwween the means.  I then did a similar analysis of each of the Lots independently-- the summary of the analysis can be found in the pngs labeled Lot1_statistics.png, Lot2_statistics.png, and Lot3_statistics.png. I was unable to reject the null hypothesis on both Lot1 and Lot2; however Lot3 showed a significant difference in the mean from the population . Lot 3 had a p.value of approximately .04 which was below the statisitical threshold of .05% and therefore I was able to reject the null hypothesis---there was a statistical difference in the means.
